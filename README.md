# File_Manager
A powerful and easy-to-use tool for automating file and folder management tasks.


## Description
This tool is an all-in-one solution for managing files and folders, designed to be easy for everyone to use—whether you're technical or not. It combines simple features with powerful automation to handle everything from basic tasks to more advanced ones.
One of the key features is workflows, which let you automate a series of steps. For example, you can set up a workflow to unzip a folder, find and rename a file, delete another file, and then zip the folder again all in one go.
The tool is easy to use with a simple interface, supports headless automation, and works with file input, so it’s perfect for any type of user.
